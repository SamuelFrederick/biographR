<p>We often work with unstructured text but want to extract some
specific structured data from this text. We could read through each text
and extract the desired information manually; however, this is
time-consuming and could be infeasible with larger numbers of texts. The
function [get_bio()] allows us to extract desired data from unstructured
texts using the ChatGPT API.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an API Key for ChatGPT, you should create one
through OpenAI before attempting to use this package. For simplicity,
you can save this API key to your .Renviron (Note: the function
[usethis::edit_r_environ()] may prove helpful here).</p>
<p>As an example, we can scrape the biography of actor Adam Driver from
Wikipedia using the <code>rvest</code> package.</p>

<h2 id="using-get_bio-to-extract-data">Using <code>get_bio()</code> to extract data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-get_bio-to-extract-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>Now that we have a real example of an unstructured biography, we can
decide what information we want to extract from the text. In practice,
it’s helpful to read through a sample of unstructured texts to find out
what type of information tends to be included in the texts and to create
a gold standard set of information to check against the ChatGPT
output.</p>
<p>The Adam Driver biography from Wikipedia contains a variety of
information that might be interesting for potential study (his date of
birth, place of birth, college, military experience, marriage, etc.). We
use the [get_bio()] function to call ChatGPT’s API to extract this
information.</p>
<p>We put the desired information fields in the
<code>prompt_fields</code> argument as a character vector. The names of
the prompt_fields should be informative (people reading the fields
should be able to understand what specific information you want the
field to contain). If you don’t pass any information to the
<code>prompt_fields</code> argument, the function returns the default
biographical fields: birth_date, highest_level_of_education, college,
graduate_school, previous_occupation, gender, town_of_birth,
state_of_birth, married, number_of_children.</p>
<p>For certain fields, you might want information returned in a specific
format (e.g., dates in MM/DD/YYYY format); you can pass this information
through the <code>prompt_fields_format</code> argument as a named list
with names corresponding to values in prompt_fields.</p>
<p>Finally, we might want to restrict certain fields to only take
certain values: the <code>prompt_fields_values</code> argument allows us
to pass this information as a named list of vectors with acceptable
values for each field in each vector.</p>
